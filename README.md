# HTML Projects
 Some projects I made through the learning process 

## Info on Brown Bears
## Fashion Blog

In these projects I learnt how to work with different HTML Elements to write and create well-structured and readable HTML code.

## Wine Schedule

Through learning how to create tables in HTML, I was able to create this schedule.

## Form A Story

Having learnt the intricacies of creating forms using HTML, this project uses a form to collect info from a user that ultimately contributes to a story once submitted.
